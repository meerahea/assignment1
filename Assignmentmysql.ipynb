    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: SQL databases are based on a structured data model, known as the relational model. Data is organized into tables \n",
    "with predefined schemas, consisting of rows (records) and columns (fields).\n",
    "Schema and Flexibility: SQL databases have a fixed schema, meaning that the structure and types of data must be defined in \n",
    "advance.Adding or modifying the schema can be more challenging.\n",
    "Data Integrity: SQL databases enforce data integrity constraints, such as enforcing relationships between tables and ensuring \n",
    "data consistency through features like primary keys and foreign keys.\n",
    "Queries: SQL databases use SQL as the standard language for querying and manipulating data. SQL offers a powerful set of \n",
    "declarative commands for retrieving and manipulating data.\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases are generally vertically scalable, meaning they can handle increased load by increasing the \n",
    "hardware resources of a single server. They excel in handling structured and complex relationships between data.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: NoSQL databases use a variety of data models, such as key-value, document, columnar, and graph. These models are\n",
    "more flexible and allow for storing unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "Schema and Flexibility: NoSQL databases have a flexible schema, allowing for dynamic and schema-less data storage. Data can \n",
    "be added without predefined structure, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements.\n",
    "Data Integrity: NoSQL databases often prioritize scalability and performance over enforcing strict data integrity constraints.\n",
    "However, some NoSQL databases provide mechanisms for eventual consistency or limited constraints.\n",
    "Queries: NoSQL databases use different query languages depending on the database type. Some NoSQL databases support SQL-like\n",
    "querying, while others use proprietary query languages specific to their data model.\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, meaning they can handle increased load by distributing \n",
    "the data across multiple servers or nodes. They excel in handling large-scale data and high traffic volumes."
