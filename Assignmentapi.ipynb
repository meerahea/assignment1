    "'''REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) are two architectural styles used for \n",
    "designing web services.\n",
    "REST:\n",
    "REST is an architectural style that emphasizes simplicity, scalability, and statelessness. It is widely used in modern web \n",
    "applications and APIs. RESTful services rely on standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on \n",
    "resources identified by unique URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). \n",
    "Here are some key characteristics of REST:\n",
    "Stateless: RESTful services are stateless, meaning the server does not store any information about the client's state. Each\n",
    "request from the client contains all the necessary information to process it, making the server independent of the client's\n",
    "context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource-based: REST treats everything as a resource that can be identified by a unique URL. Resources can be accessed and \n",
    "manipulated using standard HTTP methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform interface: REST follows a uniform interface consisting of standard HTTP methods, status codes, and media types (such\n",
    "as JSON or XML) for data representation. This uniformity simplifies the development and integration of RESTful services.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP:\n",
    "SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services using XML (eXtensible Markup Language). It defines \n",
    "a set of rules and formats for communication between networked devices. SOAP-based services have the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Formality: SOAP relies on XML schemas to define the structure and format of data. It provides a strict set of rules for\n",
    "message exchange, including message envelopes, headers, and body sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protocol-oriented: SOAP is a protocol that allows communication between applications over various transport protocols,\n",
    "including HTTP, SMTP, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility: SOAP supports various security and transactional features, allowing for secure and reliable communication in\n",
    "distributed systems.\n",
    "Complexity: SOAP has a more complex and verbose message format compared to REST. The XML-based structure and extensive use of\n",
    "headers and envelopes can make it more difficult to read and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance: SOAP typically requires more bandwidth due to its XML payload. This can lead to slower communication and increased\n",
    "latency, especially when dealing with large payloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: SOAP's additional processing overhead, such as XML parsing and message validation, can limit scalability compared \n",
    "to REST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tight coupling: SOAP can lead to tighter coupling between the client and the server, as the client often needs to understand \n",
    "the specific SOAP message format and schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited browser support: SOAP is primarily used in server-to-server communication and is less commonly supported by web \n",

    "REST: REST commonly uses lightweight data formats such as JSON  or XML for data representation. JSON is widely used due to its\n",

    "SOAP: SOAP uses XML as its message format. XML provides a more formal and structured way of defining the message schema,\n",
    "including complex data types and hierarchical structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statelessness:\n",
    "REST: RESTful services are stateless, meaning that the server does not store any client context. Each request from the client\n",
    "contains all the necessary information, and the server does not retain any session state between requests.\n",
    "SOAP: SOAP can be stateful or stateless, depending on how it is implemented. It allows for maintaining session state through\n",
    "the use of headers and other mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility and Simplicity:\n",
    "REST: REST focuses on simplicity, and its design principles aim to provide a lightweight and scalable architecture. It \n",
    "leverages existing HTTP methods and status codes, making it easier to understand and use.\n",
    "SOAP: SOAP is more formal and rigid in its structure. It defines a set of rules for message exchange, including message \n",
    "envelopes, headers, and body sections. SOAP can be more complex and may require additional tools and libraries for \n",
    "implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration:\n",

    "Performance:\n",

    "SOAP: SOAP messages, with their XML payload and additional processing overhead, can be bulkier and slower compared to REST.\n",
    "SOAP may have higher latency and bandwidth requirements.\n",
